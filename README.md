# Guidelines_repo_organization
## Uploading Projects:
Most projects should be uploaded to GitHub, except for certain CAD and mechanical design projects.
## Storing Raw Data: 
Raw data can be stored in other locations, such as the lab server, HiperGator, or OneDrive. Be sure to specify the data storage location in the README.md file.
## Staying Up-to-Date: 
Keep the repository up to date, for example, when your paper is finished or when you graduate.
## Privacy Settings: 
Set the repository to private until your paper is published. Once published, you may make the repository public.
